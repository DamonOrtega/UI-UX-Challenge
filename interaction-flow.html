    <h1>Use Case/Interaction Flow</h1>
    <h2>Precondition:  Collen is shopping for desktop speakers on the
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> website.
    </h2>
    <h2>Post-condition:  She found the perfect set of speakers and ordered them from
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.
    </h2>
    <h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Collen brings up the Amazon website from her favorites on the Chrome browser.</li>
            <li>On the Amazon landing page she navigates to the search bar and types in "desktop speakers."</li>
            <li>Amazon brings up many available speaker styles and options.</li>
            <li>She starts by checking the "Amazon Prime" checkbox on the left of her screen to sort out items that are not offered with free "Prime" shipping.</li>
            <li>Amazon removes all speakers not offering "Prime" shipping from the list.</li>
            <li>Colleen realizes that prices and styles vary greatly. She decides to spend mo more than $150 and no less than $80 on her speaker purchase. She fills in the appropriate dollar amounts in the "min - max" fields on the left of her screen and presses go.</li>
            <li>Amazon sorts out all the high-priced and low-priced items she is not interested in.</li>
            <li>As she's scrolling through she realizes she does not like the "PC style" speakers or something with a separate subwoofer. She decides she wants a "studio monitor" style speaker. Colleen once again checks the appropriate checkbox on the left of her screen.</li>
            <li>Amazon sorts out the items Colleen is not interested in. Only studio monitors are offered.</li>
            <li>She scrolls through her options, there are many. She sees a brand and model she's seen on YouTuber's desks and on tech review sites. She selects the "Edifier MR4 Powered Studio Monitor Speakers" offered at $129.99.</li>
            <li>Amazon takes her to the speakers where color options, reviews, and previous questions have been answered.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and looking at specs she decides on the white MR4's as they will match her new desktop setup perfectly.</li>
            <li>Colleen navigates to the "Buy Now" button to the right of the screen as has a Prime account and the website remembered her account and sign-in information.</li>
            <li>Amazon opens a window with the speakers, the day they should arrive, her shipping address, her method of payment, the total of her purchase, and finally to the lower right a "Place your order" button.</li>
            <li>She clicks the button to complete her purchase</li>
            <li>Amazon takes her to a screen where it shows that the order has been placed and details regarding the estimated delivery date and shipping address.</li>
            <li>Her order has been completed. Colleen logs off of Amazon, satisfied, and excited for her purchase to arrive.</li>
        </ul>
